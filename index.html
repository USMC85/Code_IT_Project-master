				<h2>1776</h2>
				<p>Everything in this city is worth waiting in line for.</p>
				<p>In 1776, America's Founders came together in Philadelphia to draw up a "Declaration of Independence," ending political ties to Great Britain. Written by Thomas Jefferson, it is the fundamental statement of people's rights and what government is and from what source it derives its powers:
				WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.</p>

			<div class="secondary col">
				<h2>The Founders</h2>
				<p>The Founders; were declaring that we are all equal, and that we are defined by rights that we are born with, not given to us by government.</p>
				<p> Among those rights is the right to pursue happiness--to live our lives as we think best, as long as we respect the right of all other individuals to do the same. The Founders also declared that governments are created by people to secure their rights. Whatever powers government has are not "just" unless they come from us, the people. </p>
